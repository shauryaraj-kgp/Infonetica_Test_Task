# Workflow Engine â€“ Infonetica Assignment

## ðŸ”§ Quick Start

1. **Build the project (optional):**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```
2. **Run the API:**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   The API will start and listen on:  
   `http://localhost:5000`

## API Routes

* `POST /workflow-definitions` â€“ Create workflow
* `GET /workflow-definitions` â€“ List all workflows
* `GET /workflow-definitions/{id}` â€“ Get workflow
* `GET /workflow-definitions/{id}/states` â€“ List states for a workflow
* `GET /workflow-definitions/{id}/actions` â€“ List actions for a workflow
* `POST /workflow-instances?definitionId={id}` â€“ Start new instance
* `GET /workflow-instances` â€“ List all instances
* `GET /workflow-instances/{id}` â€“ Get instance status + history
* `POST /workflow-instances/{id}/actions/{actionId}` â€“ Execute action

## Sample Payloads

### Create Workflow Definition
```json
{
  "id": "work1",
  "states": [
    { "id": "draft", "name": "Draft", "isInitial": true, "isFinal": false, "enabled": true },
    { "id": "review", "name": "Review", "isInitial": false, "isFinal": false, "enabled": true },
    { "id": "approved", "name": "Approved", "isInitial": false, "isFinal": true, "enabled": true }
  ],
  "actions": [
    { "id": "submit", "name": "Submit for Review", "enabled": true, "fromStates": ["draft"], "toState": "review" },
    { "id": "approve", "name": "Approve", "enabled": true, "fromStates": ["review"], "toState": "approved" }
  ]
}
```

### Start Workflow Instance
`POST /workflow-instances?definitionId=wf1`

### Execute Action
`POST /workflow-instances/{instanceId}/actions/submit`

## Notes & Assumptions

- **All data is in-memory only.** When the app stops, all workflows and instances are lost.
- **No database, no file persistence, no extra config.**
- **No authentication or authorization.**
- **No bin/**, **obj/**, or **Properties/** folders are needed in source control.
- **Runs on port 5000** by default (see console output for confirmation).
- **Test with curl, Postman, or any HTTP client.**

## Design Notes
- The codebase is as minimal as possible, with only the files needed for a working, in-memory workflow engine.
- All business logic is in `WorkflowService`.
- Models, storage, and endpoints are clearly separated for maintainability.
